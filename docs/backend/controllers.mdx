## Common Controller Methods

Most controllers implement these standard methods:
- `index()` - List resources
- `show()` - Display specific resource
- `store()` - Create new resource
- `update()` - Update existing resource
- `destroy()` - Delete resource

## Controller Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - All input is validated using Laravel's validation system
   - Custom validation rules are defined where needed

2. **Authorization**
   - Controllers use Laravel's authorization policies
   - Role-based access control is implemented

3. **Response Format**
   All API responses follow this structure:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {},
     "message": "Operation successful"
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error responses
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error messages in development
